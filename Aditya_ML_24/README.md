# Machine Learning Lab Assignments

This repository contains all the assignments completed during my Machine Learning Lab in college. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of data handling, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization using R or Python.

---

## List of Assignments

### 1. Data Handling and Preprocessing
Perform the following operations using R/Python on suitable datasets:
- **a)** Read data from different formats (e.g., CSV, XLS).
- **b)** Indexing and selecting data, sorting data.
- **c)** Describe attributes of the data, check data types of each column.
- **d)** Count unique values, check the format of each column, and convert variable data types (e.g., long to short and vice versa).
- **e)** Identify missing values and fill in the missing values.

### 2. Summary Statistics and Data Visualization
Perform the following operations using R/Python on datasets:
- **a)** Compute and display summary statistics for each feature in the dataset (e.g., minimum value, maximum value, mean, range, standard deviation, variance, percentiles).
- **b)** Create histograms for each feature to illustrate distributions.
- **c)** Perform data cleaning, integration, transformation, and model building (e.g., classification).

### 3. Predicting Customer Response Using ML
Apply an appropriate machine learning algorithm on a dataset collected from a cosmetics shop containing customer details. The goal is to predict customer responses to special offers.

---

### 4. K-Means Clustering
Write a program to perform K-Means clustering for the given points:

**Points:**

**Initial Centroids:**
- m1 = P1 (Cluster#1 = C1)
- m2 = P8 (Cluster#2 = C2)

**Tasks:**
- **a)** Determine which cluster P6 belongs to.
- **b)** Find the population of the cluster around m2.
- **c)** Calculate the updated values of m1 and m2.

---

### 5. Data Visualization
Visualize data using R/Python by plotting graphs for assignments 1 and 2 using a suitable dataset:
- **a)** Scatter plot, bar plot, box plot, and histogram.

Alternatively:
- **b)** Perform data visualization operations using Tableau.

### 6. Regression Techniques
**Dataset:** Download temperature data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/venky73/temperaturesof-india?select=temperatures.csv).  
This dataset contains month-wise average temperatures of India recorded in Celsius.

**Tasks:**
- **a)** Apply Linear Regression using a suitable library function to predict month-wise temperatures.
- **b)** Assess model performance using MSE (Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and R-Square metrics.
- **c)** Visualize a simple regression model.

### 7. Classification Techniques
**Dataset:** Download the Graduate Admissions dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions).  
The dataset includes GRE Scores (out of 340), TOEFL Scores (out of 120), University Rating (out of 5), Statement of Purpose strength (out of 5), Letter of Recommendation strength (out of 5), Undergraduate GPA (out of 10), Research Experience (0=no, 1=yes), and Admission Status (Admitted: 0=no, 1=yes).

**Objective:** Help counselors predict whether students will get admission based on their GRE score and academic performance by building a Decision Tree classifier.

**Steps:**
- **a)** Apply Data Preprocessing techniques like Label Encoding or Data Transformation if necessary.
- **b)** Perform Train-Test Split for data preparation.
- **c)** Apply a Machine Learning algorithm for classification.
- **d)** Evaluate the model's performance.
